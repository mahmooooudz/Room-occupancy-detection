The aim of this project is to predict whether a room is occupied or not based on the data
collected from the sensors.
The data set contains 7 attributes. The attributes are date, temperature,
humidity, light, CO2, humidity ratio and occupancy. The data set is divided into 3 data
sets for training and testing. The data set provides experimental data used for binary
classification (room occupancy of an office room) from Temperature, Humidity, Light and
CO2. Ground-truth occupancy was obtained from time stamped pictures that were taken
every minute.
